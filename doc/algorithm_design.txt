In creating an evolutionary algorithm, the pseudo code for an evolutionary algorithm is detailed below:

1. initialise population with random candidate solutions;
2. evaluate each candidate
3. Repeat until Terminiation condition is satisfied do:
4. 
- select parents
- Recombine pairs of parentsmutate the resulting offspring
- evaluate new candidates
- select individuals for the next generation

For TSP

1. initialise population with random permutations of city indices (each perm = a tour) : 20, 50,100,200 (number of permutations)
2. Evaluate each candidate solution by calculating the total tour length using city coordinates

3. while( max generation -> 2000 for the exercise 6){
    1. select parents: two tours using tournamet selection, roulette wheel
    2. apply crossover on parent pairsas
    3. apply mutation to off spring
    4. evaluate offspring tour lengths
    5. select individuals for next generation  (keep best N solutions)

    decide on which way to replace population: 
    either:
    1. Generational replacement: replace entire population 
    2. steady-state replacement: insert offspring into the population by replacing some fo the worse individuals (this oneis better)
    e.g population 50: two parents have two children soo populuation = 52. pick the best 50 to survive and then repeat..... using a priotity queue
}     

4. pick the best tour in the final population.
