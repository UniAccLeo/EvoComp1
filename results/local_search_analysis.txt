Across the three neighbourhood algorithms, 2-opt consistently outperformed both jump and exchange methods in terms 
of producing the lowest minimum and mean tour costs. The jump algorithm generally provided better results over 
exchange, however both of these algorithms showed poor stability as the tour costs achieved varied significantly 
across trials. Generally, all algorithms had strong performances with small tours, however the scalability 
limitations was highlighted with larger tours such as PR2392 and USA13509. For both of these tours the majority of 
trials reached the maximum iteration limit suggesting it likely failed to converge to a local optima. 
This highlights the computational inefficiencies of local search for very large TSPs.
