For TSP design of the algorithm
1. initialise population with random permutations of city indices (each perm = a tour) : 20, 50,100,200 (number of permutations)
2. Evaluate each candidate solution by calculating the total tour length using city coordinates
3. while( max generation -> 2000 for the exercise 6){
    1. select parents: two tours using tournamet selection, roulette wheel
    2. apply crossover on parent pairsas
    3. apply mutation to off spring
    4. evaluate offspring tour lengths
    5. select individuals for next generation  (keep best N solutions)

    decide on which way to replace population: 
    either:
    1. Generational replacement: replace entire population 
    2. steady-state replacement: insert offspring into the population by replacing some fo the worse individuals (this oneis better)
    e.g population 50: two parents have two children soo populuation = 52. pick the best 50 to survive and then repeat..... using a priotity queue
}     
4. pick the best tour in the final population.


Genetic algorihtm (GA) design 1
for my first genetic algorithm, I decided to use tournament selection for parent selection with a tournament size of 5 as 
it works well with raw fitness values and preserves diversity, which is important in finding new better tours. 5 was chosen as it creates a decently high 
selection pressure given the population sizes. I decided to implement order-crossover and inversion mutation combined together as it allows the algorihtm too exploit 
the good solutions using crossover(maintains the good sequences - small change) while exploring new solutions using inversion, which is a drastic
change to the tour. I used a generation replacement with strong elitism, again to maintain diversity, which would be important for when u run the 
algorithm for many more generations. ( (μ + λ) selection)

GA Design 2 
For the second algorithm, I decided to change the crosover and mutation algorithm with ERX and insert mutation. 
ERX mutation is a really good exploiter for graph problems and therefore needs a diverse range of parents to combine, so 
using FPS which frequently picks the same winner/random winner is inefficient. Thus tournament parent selection is used instead.
Insert mutation was used as it is medium to high level of exploratiuon which is sufficient in providing small incremental improvement. Perhaps 
making it even better the longer the generations run. I'm using generational replacement as its sufficient compard to steady state where it replaces the 
worst individual every team which means number of iterations would be much larger.


GA design3:
For this third algorithm I tried something a lot more different to 1 and 2. I decided to make a slower convergence using the fitness proportion selection 
for the parents. Im using a cycle crossover and a swap mutation with the idea that cycle crossover keeps cities in their absolute positions from parents and swap mutation similarly 
gently explores nearby arrangments of the tour. Unlike Design2 thisalgirihtm is less prone to premature convergence which means maints a higher dviersity throughout the run. 
In terms of the replacement strategy, since its a lot slower, a generational replacement makes sense here as it allows the diversity maintained by FPS to persits 
longer
