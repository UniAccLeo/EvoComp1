It was evident through results that our evolutionary algorithms performed much better than the inverover algorithm, 
with the GA2 algorithm generating a 2x shorter route for shorter routes such as eil51 and up to 5-6x shorter routes 
for longer routes such as lin105. The inverover algorithm also had a much higher standard deviation, 
likely due to the random initialisation not producing many good routes and therefore taking more time before 
the algorithm finds better routes and improves. This can be seen in the inverover_any_route.txt file which outperformed 
our algorithms at the cost of computational power.
